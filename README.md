# Chick Vascular Quantification App

This app quantifies chick vascular structure within microscopy images using a computer vision and deep learning algorithm. The application is based on tkinter UI and utilises Tensorflow for the neural network. Furthemore the ability to connect a microscopy camera has been added to quantify the chick vascular structure real-time.

An overview of the workflow is given by the figure underneath:
